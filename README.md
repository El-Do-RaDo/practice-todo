# practice-todo: 
is project is just my practice app I made using django and angular for practice it's a To-Do app.

## **Django:**
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. 

* **Versatile**

     Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website — from content management systems and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. 

* **Secure**

     Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes by providing a framework that has been engineered to "do the right things" to protect the website automatically. 

* **Scalable**

     Django uses a component-based “shared-nothing” architecture (each part of the architecture is independent of the others, and can hence be replaced or changed if needed).

## **Angular:**
HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
